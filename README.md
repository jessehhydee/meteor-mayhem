# Meteor Mayhem
### Progressively difficult game.

Everything apart from the rocket is procedually generated. No two game experiences are ever the same.

As your rocket fly's through space, you must avoid more and more asteroids in your flight path. 
See how far you can get before the fog of asteroids take you out!
